I let ChatGPT analyse the resouces.sh script

This Bash script appears to analyze and document information about processes running on a system. Let's break down the script step by step:

base_dir="${HOME}/.local/share/safe/node": This line sets the base_dir variable to the path ~/.local/share/safe/node, which is typically 
located in the user's home directory.

declare -A dir_pid: This declares an associative array called dir_pid, which will be used to store directory names as keys and corresponding 
process IDs (PIDs) as values.

node_number=0: Initializes a variable node_number to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of nodes being processed.

The script enters a for loop that iterates over each directory within the base_dir. 
The loop checks if there is a file named safenode.pid inside each directory and, if found, retrieves the PID and stores it in the dir_pid associative array.

Another for loop iterates over the keys of the dir_pid associative array, which are directory names containing the nodes.

Inside the second loop, the script performs the following tasks for each node:

Prints timestamps in both local and global (UTC) time.
Displays the node number, directory name, and PID.
Uses the ps command to fetch memory and CPU usage information for the specified PID.
Prints the status, memory usage, and CPU usage.
Counts the number of file descriptors associated with the process.
Checks if a directory named record_store exists in the node's directory and, if so, counts the number of records and displays disk usage.
Retrieves the rewards balance for the node using an external command, likely related to the "safe" application.
Prints a newline for better readability.
Finally, the script prints a line of hyphens to separate the output for different nodes.

Overall, this script is designed to gather and display information about processes associated with nodes within a specific directory structure.
It collects data on process timestamps, status, resource usage, file descriptors, records, disk usage, and rewards balance for each node. The script
provides a structured report for multiple nodes in the specified directory.
